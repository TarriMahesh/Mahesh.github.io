        <h1><u>Back End</u></h1>
        <h3>The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to</h3>
        <h3>operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored</h3>
        <h3>and accessed in the back end of a computer system. Typically the code is comprised of one</h3>
        <h3>or more programming languages. The back end is also called the data access layer of</h3>
        <h3>software or hardware and includes any functionality that needs to be accessed and</h3>
        <h3>navigated to by digital means. <u>There are some popular languages </u>PYTHON JAVA <b></b> </h3>

        <h1><u>JAVA</u></h1>
        <h3>Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform</h3>
        <h3>that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices,</h3>
        <h3>gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are</h3>
        <h3>based on the C and C++ languages.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Java is a technology consisting of both a programming language and a software</h3>
        <h3>platform. To create an application using Java, you need to download the Java</h3>
        <h3>Development Kit (JDK), which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You write</h3>
        <h3>the program in the Java programming language, then a compiler turns the program</h3>
        <h3>into Java bytecodeâ€”the instruction set for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a</h3>
        <h3>part of the Java runtime environment (JRE). Java bytecode runs without modification</h3>
        <h3>on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code to be run anywhere.</h3>

        <h1><u>PYTHON</u></h1>
        <h3>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,</h3>
        <h3>including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is </h3>
        <h3>often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</h3>
        <h3>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming </h3>
        <h3>language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python </h3>
        <h3>3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier </h3>
        <h3>verPython 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2</h3>
